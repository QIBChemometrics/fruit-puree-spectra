# fruit-puree-spectra
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra of 983 fresh fruit purees. 

Obtained using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling.
Independent samples, prepared from raw fruits, as follows: 351 pure strawberry, 159 pure raspberry, and the remainder 'neither' (these include a variety of other fruits, as well as 'adulterated' strawberry and raspberry purees, containing >10% w/w of other fruits). 

Raw data matrix size [983 x 235]. Contains header column (frequency in wavenumbers) and four header rows: logicak indexing for strawberry, raspberry, or neither, and a text descriptor row.
